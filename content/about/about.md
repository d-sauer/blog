I’m software engineer with most background in developing web based business applications. Above all I prefer elegant solutions, mostly in Java. But I’m also opened for other technologies, languages and approaches and most of all...challenges and opportunities to learn something new.

On programming free time I like to research, finding new new solutions and approaches and implementing new ideas that I have during research or finding some feature in another language, and try to provide similar or maybe better solution in java.

Computer science and mostly programming start to interest me in primary school where I started learning Basic and short after Microsoft Visual Basic. After while in High school and College there was C/C++ and more Visual Basic and some PHP and couple of databases, and then it comes…
beginning of the end or awakening, whatever you wanna call it, I have coffee in one hand and Java in another. Love at first sight. 


Point of interests and specialities:
  - Java
  - software engineering, software architecture
  - finding best practice and new approaches
  - design patterns, API design
  - web applications and development in cluster environment
  - application performance
  - test driven development
  - Databases, SQL and lately NoSql
